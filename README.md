# Junior-Naver (KOR)

This project is a recreation of Junior Naver website (https://jr.naver.com/) using java GUI. 
Jr. Naver is a Korean website created by Naver corp that is designed for younger children to enjoy various content that ranges from education to games.
In this project, I focused on recreating certain functions instead of the entire website, such as login, sign-up, delete account, logout, six different games, and ranking. 
The six games included are not specifically Junior Naver games, but are games that are familiar to many people. I selected 1 to 50, Snake game, Typing game, Racing game (was originally five horses racing, but replaced with turtles considering that Jr. Naver website is for younger children; horses felt a little like betting), Five in a Row (omok), and Ladder game. Each games have their own standard of ranking, such as the winner is the player that finished the game fastest, won the most stages, etc. 
_WordGame.java is the main file.
