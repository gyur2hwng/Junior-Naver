# Junior Naver (KOR)

This project is a recreation of Junior Naver website (https://jr.naver.com/) using java GUI. 

Features: sign in page (sign up, sign in, sign out, delete account), duplicate ID check when signing in, find ID & PW, six different games, ranking

Jr. Naver is a Korean website created by Naver corp that is designed for younger children to enjoy various content that ranges from education to games.
In this project, I focused on recreating certain functions instead of the entire website, such as login, sign-up, delete account, logout, six different games, and ranking. 

The six games included are not specifically Junior Naver games, but are games that are familiar to many people. The six games are 1 to 50, Snake game, Typing game, Racing game, Five in a Row (omok), and Ladder game. Each games have their own separate rank codes because winners are determined on different standards for each of them. 

_WordGame.java is the main file.
